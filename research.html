                <p>
                    During the spring of 2020, I took an introductory seismology class, more out of curiosity than anything else. A few weeks 
                    before Harvard sent all undergraduates home, my professor, Marine A. Denolle mentioned that she had a few opportunties 
                    doing research with her group. I jumped at the chance and when my original summer plans were cancelled, I was able to stay
                    on for the summer. From group meetings and presentations, to outside talks and question sessions, to debugging code and most
                    recently submitting an abstract for AGU this fall, I've gotten to experience what working on, and for the most part leading, a
                    long-term research project is like. The current plan is to continue research into the fall and write several papers about our 
                    project and results (see below). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project I'm working on involves using seismic data from California to produce large-scale ambient noise cross-correlations (ANCC), with
                    the goal of running these correlations for a 20 year period. These cross-correlations are mostly used for tomography and monitoring to, 
                    for example, study groundwater level changes, map velocities of seismic waves, and predict groundmotion in an earthquake. As the number
                    of cross-correlations we need to compute is so large, I've learned the high-performance computing language Julia (no, sadly it's not named 
                    after me) as well as the interfaces for Amazon's EC2 and S3 cloud computing and storage interfaces, as we expect to process several terabytes 
                    of data. While my focus has been building the codes and infrastructure to run the cross-correlations, we've been working with seismologists at Stanford and San Diego State Universities
                    to expand our correlation network to the whole of California, and cross-validate a Los Angeles earthquake simulation with the ANCCs, respectively. 
                    The abstract to the paper I'm working on this fall, along with my professor, a graduate student, and the Stanford team, can be found above.
