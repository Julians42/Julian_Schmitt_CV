                <h2>Comprehensive California-wide large-scale noise cross correlations </h2>
                <p class="subDetails">Julian Schmitt, Tim Clements, Lise Retailleau, Aurelien Mordret, Greg Beroza,  Marine A. Denolle</p>

                    Ambient noise cross-correlations have proven use in crustal tomography, structure, and source monitoring. We combine 
                    all available seismic data in the state of California since 2000 until 2020, which accumulates over 2000 asynchronous 
                    3-component stations combining the Northern California Earthquake Data Center, the Southern California Seismic Network, 
                    and temporary arrays available at IRIS and nodal data from the BASIN experiment (Clayton et al, 2019). The total original
                    data size is on the order of 200TB. We create three libraries of ambient noise cross-correlations. The first is a 
                    low-frequency, 1Hz sampling rate, accounting for all station pairs that are spaced by at least 20 km and cover the entire 
                    state. The second, intermediate frequency correlation functions of 20 Hz sampling rate, links all stations within 300 km. 
                    The third is all of the station autocorrelations sampled at 100 Hz or below depending on the instrument.  Here, we frame a 
                    methodology to compute large scale cross correlations by leveraging cloud computing, GPU processing, and performant scripting
                    in the Julia language, presented in a companion abstract (Clements et al.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We keep daily-stacks of the correlation functions to perform monitoring of shallow structure, such as the impact of 
                    groundwater on seismic velocities, or deeper structure over the course of 20 years. The full stacks of the correlation 
                    functions can be used for crustal tomography, either with travel-time information or with the full waveforms. The full 
                    stacks are also used for ground motion prediction in Los Angeles for future earthquakes in another companion abstract 
                    (Denolle et al.).

                <h2>Illuminating Snow Droughts: The Future of Snowpack in the Western United States</h2>
                <p class="subDetails">Julian Schmitt, Kai-Chih Tseng, Mimi Hughes, Nathaniel Johnson</p>
                <p>
                    Sustained snowpack in the Western United States (WUS) is crucial for meeting summer hydrological 
					demands, reducing the intensity and frequency of wildfires, and supporting snow-tourism economies. 
					By developing a nonparametric drought classification scheme for monthly snowpack, we can characterize 
					regions by snow drought severity. Using the Seamless System for Prediction and EArth System Research 
					Large Ensemble (SPEAR-MED LE, hereafter SPEAR)1 , we find that the incidence of severe drought (SD) 
					increases ~25-50% from the early to late historical period (1930-1970 vs 1971-2011) across large WUS
					 watershed regions. An observationally based dataset2 validates these findings. All watershed regions 
					 experience observed changes in SD occurrence that fall within the SPEAR ensemble spread, and 3 of the 
					 5 regions experience observed increases in SD occurrence similar to the ensemble mean change. The second
					  half of the historical period also experiences 60-70% increases in anomalously hot winter days, with 
					  nights also becoming significantly warmer. The climatology predicted by SPEAR under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 
					  shows even more dramatic increases in SD occurrence. Under RCP 8.5, we find a quintupling in SD 
					  frequency by 2050, while RCP 4.5 sees the same increase by 2070. By examining the temperature and 
					  precipitation climatologies alongside the SD changes, we determine the increase in SD is driven by 
					  rapid warming after 2000, while average precipitation increases slightly. Temperature continues to 
					  increase dramatically after 2000, with the average anomalies surpassing 2 standard deviations above 
					  the mean by 2090 under RCP 8.5, and 1.5 standard deviations under RCP 4.5. We close by examining 
					  implications for the WUSâ€™s environment and economy.
