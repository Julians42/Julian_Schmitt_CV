					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am a Harvard College student from Vermont concentrating in Applied Mathematics with a focus in 
						Earth and Planetary Sciences. With a foundation in pure mathematics, statistics, and computer science, 
						I envision myself using these skills to pursue research in earth science as I am passionate about the 
						outdoors. This summer I am researching virtual earthquakes under Marine Denolle in the 
						<a href="https://quake.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard Seismology</a> group. Outside of academics I ski on the 
						Harvard Varsity Nordic ski team and am a somewhat accomplished trumpet player.</p>

					<h2>Seismology Research Position</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">March 2020 - Present</p>
					<p>I am working in Julia and on AWS to help create an updated model of expected peak 
						ground velocities during a future LA area earthquake using M. Denolle’s ambient 
						noise cross-correlation method. The project, called BASIN is focused on improving 
						ground motion predictions in the Los Angeles area via both empirical (my project) 
						and numerical modeling approaches (others at SDSU, Caltech, and Stanford).</p>

					<h2>Case Analyst for Harvard CBE</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Spring 2019</p>
					<p>In the spring of 2019 I worked on a Harvard Undergraduate <a href="https://www.harvardcbe.com/">Consulting for Business
						 and the Environment</a> case team developing a food waste management protocol for a 
						 large non-profit. Personally, I was responsible for data analytics, working to 
						 save on disposal costs by developing an optimization model for subsidiaries to 
						 estimate the most cost-effective mixture of disposal methods. In addition to 
						 providing data-collection and communication advice, I designed a mock website 
						 which exemplified improved data collection methods, as well as providing additional
						  tools subsidiaries could use to make more informed waste management decisions.</p>

					<h2>Co-founder of River House Tutoring</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Summer 2020</p>
					<p>Co-founder of <a href="riverhousetutoring.com">River House Tutoring</a> which three of 
						my Harvard peers and I developed in Summer 2020 in order to offset income lost from 
						summer opportunities. Previously I have volunteered in a Pre-Calculus class and as a 
						tutor for my high school’s learning resource lab. I have also privately tutored several 
						students through Geometry, Algebra II, and a basic Cryptography course for elementary students. </p>

					<h2>Math Modeling</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Spring 2017 and 2018</p>
					<p>My Middlebury Mathematics Team competed in both the 2017 and 2018 national Moody’s, and 
						subsequently MathWorks, <a href="https://m3challenge.siam.org/">Math Modeling Challenges</a>. In 2017, we earned a scholarship placing
						in the top five percent of teams while investigating the effects of climate change on the US’s
						five coastal National Parks. In 2018, the team investigated the issue of food waste, placing in 
						the top 6 teams out of 913, each earning a $1000 scholarship and the opportunity to present our 
						findings on an all-expenses paid trip to Jane Street Financial in New York City. </p>
